>An important file which contains the function for segregating
flows into the direction forward and backward.

>forward packets are decided on the direction of the first arriving
packet in the flow (src and dst ip addresses)

>backward packets will have the opposite values of the src and dst
ip address.

>The segregation is important in calculation of the forward, backward
and the flow inter arrival times in the statistics.py file
